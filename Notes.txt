install Django extension in VS code: Django (Baptiste Darthenay)

Creating a project : $ django-admin startproject (project Name)
The development server : come inside the project and use the code --> $ python manage.py runserver

to create an APP: python manage.py startapp (APP Name)

URL Dispatcher : The Url follows this path 
MyFirstProject -->  Urls --> Home.urls and inside the Home Urls --> Whichever matches the input URL it will redirected that APP Urls

Created a two folders (Static and template)
static : add the static files like images, texts so on. 
    - anyone come to the server and check this file.
    - note : Don't keep imp files in static bcz it will not safe, it will cause a security loop holes...or security issues.
    - Always keep the public files.

    we have this in settings under project folder 

templates :

python manage.py makemigrations :   checks the changes 
python manage.py migrate : 
python manage.py createsuperuser : to create a super user

{% csrf_token %} : used bcz when we submit the form make sure that form is submitted by u r website only not an external website so we used this.

Models:
that define a class
frst step is to create a model in Models
next "admin.site.register(Contact)" using this we have to register our models in admin.py.
next from apps.py copy the name of the app and paste it under the settings >> Installed apps.
 (register the model >> register the app >> app define and run the migrations)
next >> python manage.py makemigrations 

next >> python manage.py migrate   >> to create a table and apply the changes
 now you can check in admin panel

 makemigrations : create changes and stores in a file.
 migrate : apply the pending changes created by makemigrations

 def __str__(self):
        return self.name 
        
    we can get the name of the admin
